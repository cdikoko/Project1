# Project1
## Computer Programming II (Java), CS 232
##Introduction

* Authors: Austin Anderson and Clement Dikoko
* Date: February 22,2016
* Purpose: This program will ready a text file of names and output the names in alphabetical order by last name in their own individual files.


This program was assigned in my Computer Programming II course. The goal of this assignment, was to get the students to become familiar with sorting methods in java. The program takes a list of first names and last names and then output the names in alphabetical order by last name in their own individual files. 

##Instructions

This program only contains one class, so to run it the user needs to download it to their computer with the text file containing the list of names. Next the user needs to find and compile the file through the command line. 

##Names

This project was made using only one class, this was the first project that I have ever completed using the Java programming language.
To begin, I first created methods to get and set the first name and last name in the file. The format of the file is a long list of full names that each take up one line.


There are several names that repeat themselves in the list, first and last, which made it very harrd to find the correct method to sort through them.
